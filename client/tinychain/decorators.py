def closure(*deps):

    Annotation to capture data referenced by an :class:`Op` and return a `Closure`.

    The returned `Closure` can be called with the same parameters as the :class:`Op`.

    **Important**: the captured data may be large (e.g. an entire `Table`) if a closure is serialized over the network.

    Example:
        .. highlight:: python
        .. code-block:: python
